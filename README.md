# ThermochemAutoTable
When doing thermochemistry calculations, one often has to do table lookups to find values needed to solve a particular problem,
as the equations that govern the relationships between the variables of a system of water are too complicated to calculate explicitly.
This program does that table lookup for you, given the values are on the tables somewhere, removing the need to constantly have to check table values

This turned out to be much harder than origionally anticipated, as the usage of the thermochemistry tables requires some intuition for humans to
use, and so writing out all the possible cases for a set of variables was an interesting challenge.
